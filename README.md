maiome library of utilities
=============================

[![Build Status](https://ci.maio.me/api/badges/maiome-development/malibu/status.svg)](https://ci.maio.me/maiome-development/malibu) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/malibu.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/malibu)

This is a library of semi-useful and hopefully reusable utilities used within a few
of the projects that are in development under the maiome namespace.

command.\*
----------
a modular, autoloading command line utility development framework.

includes two inheritable, pre-implemented modules:
 - config.py - for implementing management of an INI-style config created by `malibu.config`
 - help.py - simple module for displaying help data written in function docstrings

config.configuration
----------------------
a "simple" config reader with section promises and special types.

database.dbmapper
-----------------
*DEPRECATED*

a reflective/introspective ORM used for simple object relations in SQLite (and maybe others).

database.dbtypeconv
-------------------
*DEPRECATED*

a series of sqlite "middlewares" to do useful type conversions.

design.borgish
--------------
a class mixin loosely based on the shared-state Borg design pattern by Alex Martelli.

design.brine
------------
a class mixin used for ORM-like serialization. usable for compressing complex objects down to
simple JSON strings for storage in a database. also provides a caching object implementation that may some day have
fuzzy search.

text (functions in `__init__.py`)
---------------------------------
series of functions for text conversion and finding the correct string or unicode classes.
mainly for compatibility between Python versions.

text.ascii
----------
map of ASCII terminal color outputs with a string wrapper.

text.table
----------
relatively simple text table formatter that allows formatting of data stored in different structures.

util (functions in `__init__.py`)
---------------------------------
series of functions that are used to perform inspection of the current frame or the caller frame.

util.args
---------
flexible command line argument parser.

util.decorators
---------------
package of generators that create decorators that can be attached to object instances or other things.

util.log
--------
logging driver that sits on top of Python's built-in logging module to simplify logger usage and provide
more informative statements by way of caller inspection

util.names
----------
simple random name generator.

util.scheduler
--------------
a simple tick-based scheduler suitable for use in ticking event loops.
now supports pluggable job stores for persisting jobs in external databases such as Redis, Riak, etc.
